# Assignment One
The following provides the details necessary to run the scripts for assignment one.

## Part A

### Three Bar Truss Analysis
Run the `three_bar_truss_analysis.py` script to execute the three bar truss analysis.

### Ten Bar Truss Analysis
Run the `ten_bar_truss_analysis.py` script to execute the ten bar truss analysis.

### Code Profiler
Run the `solver_profiler.py` script to profile the truss analysis code on a densely connected 16 node truss.

## Part B

### Validation
Run the `rbf_collocation_solver_validation.py` script to plot the solution curves for the different RBF functions against the actual solution.

### Convergence
Run the `convergence.py` script to plot the L2 norm of the error for different step sizes.

### Shape Parameter Effects
Run the `shape_parameter_effects.py` script to plot the L2 norm of the error for different shape parameters.
