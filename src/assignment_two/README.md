# Assignment Two
The following provides the details necessary to run the scripts for assignment two.

## Free-Response Analysis
Run the `free_vibration_analysis_driver.py` script to perform the free-response analysis on the different meshes and plot their displacement responses.

## Frequency Response

### Full-Order Dynamic Stiffness Matrix
Run the `forced_vibration_full_order_analysis_driver.py` script to calculate and plot the frequency response for the different meshes using the full-order dynamic stiffness matrix.

### Modal Analysis
Run the `forced_vibration_modal_analysis_driver.py` script to calculate and plot the frequency response for the different meshes using a modal approximation.

Run the `forced_vibration_modal_analysis_error_driver.py` script to calculate and plot the absolute approximation error for the modal analysis using mesh 4 for different number of modes.
